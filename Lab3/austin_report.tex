\subsubsection{The Diffusion Equation}
For the pure diffusion equation describes an initial pulse which diffuses into
the surrounding fluid. The one dimensional diffusion equation is:
\begin{equation}
  u_t = \beta u_{xx}
\end{equation}
where $\beta$ is the diffusion coefficient. The exact solution for $x$ over the
interval $\[0, 1\]$ for the initial condition $u(0, x) = \sin(\pi x)$ and
boundary conditions $u(t, 0) = u(t, 1) = 0$ is:
\begin{equation}
  u(t, x) = e^{- \beta \pi^2 t} \sin(\pi x)
\end{equation}
In order to solve the equation numerically, we can change the diffusion equation
into a FD equation. Replacing the time derivative with a first order forward
difference scheme and the spatial derivative by a centred difference scheme
results in the equation:
\begin{equation}
  u_i^{n+1} = u_i^n + r \left( u_{i+1}^n - 2 u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n \right)
\end{equation}
where the Courant number is $r = \frac{\beta \Delta t}{(\Delta x)^2$.
